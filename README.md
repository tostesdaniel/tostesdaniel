# Hi there! I'm Daniel üëã

Like many developers, I love solving real problems through code. I'm a fullstack developer based in Brazil, and I get excited about creating tools that make people's lives easier. These days, you'll find me working with Next.js, TypeScript, and crafting smooth user experiences with Tailwind CSS.

## My Latest Project: Rust Conveyor Filters

Ever spent hours setting up conveyor filters in Rust, only to realize you need to do it again next wipe? Yeah, me too. That's why I built Rust Conveyor Filters ‚Äì a tool that lets you create, save, and share your loot sorting setups without wasting your time every week.

Think of it as your companion for base organization. You can experiment with different filter configurations, share your setups with others, and even import your existing in-game filters and save them for later use.

### What Makes It Special
- üõ†Ô∏è Design your filters visually, just like you would in-game
- üîÑ Take your work straight into Rust with import/export features
- üìö Browse what others have created and spend no time at all
- üì± Works smoothly on both your PC and phone
- üåô Easy on the eyes with dark and light modes

### The Community Aspect
What started as a personal tool has grown into something bigger. Players are sharing their setups, creating dozens of filters, and suggesting improvements. I love seeing how people use the tool I crafted with so much love! Through community feedback I've fixed numerous bugs and added features based on real player requests ‚Äì it's been an amazing journey of continuous improvement.

## Let's Connect!
